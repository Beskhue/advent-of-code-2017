# Advent of Code 2017 solutions
This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/), written in Rust.

My goal is not to create the most beautiful solutions, nor the most efficient.
Instead I'm using this as a fun way to learn the Rust.

## Compiling and running a solution
To compile and run a solution, you can use Cargo:

```bash
cargo run --bin december01
```
